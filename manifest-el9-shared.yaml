  # zram-generator-0.3.2 (shipped in centOS 9) provides a default zram-generator
  # config, we want to disable it. We don't need this in el10 because the config
  # was split in a subpackage we don't pull in.

  # We added this for https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3117
  # because something changed between rhel8 and rhel9 to not
  # generate this by default but we had containers that expected it
  # to exist to be mounted. We include it in RHEL 9, but the
  # containers were fixed in [1] so we won't include it in RHEL 10.
